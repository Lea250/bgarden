            <p> Thank you for visiting my first project. 
                It wasn't easy, but it was a lot of fun.
            </p>
            <p> I appreciate all the help I've gotten from the wonderful TechConnect Team.
                And I am especially grateful to Sheldon,  my very good teacher, who has a lot of patience.
                He knows how to help people to understand every single detail.
            </p>
            <p> I enjoyed taking the pictures at the Botanical Garden.
                And, I hope, every page becomes colorful with those pictures and beautiful to the viewer.
            </p>
            <p> You are welcome to share with me your comments about my work.
                I look forward to hearing from you.
                This is my email:  Lea250@gmail.com

            <p> Have a good time and see you there!
